# Demtalk

This project was created for my dissertation/summer project on my MSc Computer Science conversion course. It is a group chat instant messaging app for Android. It also utilizes the SQLite handset database to save useful URL links for reference.

It was designed with the idea of creating a safe space for young caregivers of family members with dementia. The app would allow them to easily converse and share information with their peers in their limited spare time.

The core chat and link saving functionality has been implemented. I am currently working on improving the app to the point where it could be added to the Play Store. Features to add and objectives include:

- A permanent remote server space
- Improved UI with Fragments
- Improved performance
- Polished and more intuitive link function
