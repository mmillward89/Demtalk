# Demtalk

This project was created for my dissertation on my CS conversion course. It is a group chat instant messaging app for Android.
It also includes a database to save useful URL links for reference. The project is ongoing and looking to add the ability to filter
conversations based on a link, and copy links directly to the database from conversation. It also needs to be worked on to improve
reliability, particularly in regards to the connection to the server.
